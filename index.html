      <p>The table above is my best guesstimate as to how many donuts might be consumed by these three countries in 2020. The reality is that no one knows for sure how many will be consumed this year. It would take a lot of time and effort to count them all, and to be honest I would rather spend that time going out for a jog then stopping in at my favorite local donut shop for a tasty maple glazed donut.<p>
